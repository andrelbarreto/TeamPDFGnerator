# Usage

This application allows a user to generate a webpage that displays information regarding members of a team based on prompts and stored user inputs using the command-line, the team can have add members and each can be assigned a position.

A project manager, department head or developer lead can use the application to generate basic team details quickly for a website that can be referenced by stakeholders or boards without having to navigate to external profiles provided by each team member. 


When the command line prompts are complete, a team.html page will save to "output" folder.

The generated page will include cards for each member of the team with:
- name
- title
- id
- role (manager, intern, engineer)
- depending on the role, github username, school, or office number
